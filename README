A simple python script to convert the output of the dbus monitor command to dbus-send commands
Usage should be self explanatory and you might have to edit the script for it to fit your requirements
The script is currently customized to work with the dbus found on an Amazon Alexa (see my other repo)

Testet with python3 and python2
